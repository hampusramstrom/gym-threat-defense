# Gym Threat Defense Example
A couple of example of solving the 'normal' threat defense environment and,
a couple that utilizes the INSPECT action in the other environment to achieve
better results:

Threat Defense Environment algorithms:
* Q-learning (ql_agent_example)
* Policy Gradient (policy_gradient_agent)

Threat Defense Environment with INSPECT action algorithms:
* Myopic (myopic_agent)
* n-step ahead (n_ahead_agent)

## Dependencies
- OpenAI Gym
- Gym Threat Defense
- Numpy
- Tensorflow

## Run example

```bash
cd example
python ql-agent-example.py
```
